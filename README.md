# euler-ocaml

Project Euler problem solutions written in OCaml.

## Dependencies

1. GNU Make (others might work but I haven't tried)
2. [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html) (Duh.)
3. ocamlbuild: `opam install ocamlbuild`
4. core_kernel: `opam install core_kernel`
5. bignum: `opam install bignum`

## Building & Running

Build it with `make`. Run it with `./main.native` to run all problems, or give
it a numeric argument to run a specific problem.
