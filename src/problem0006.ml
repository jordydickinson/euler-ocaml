  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
  
  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
  
  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
  numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
  natural numbers and the square of the sum.
